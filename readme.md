A Kotlin/Multiplatform interface for quantum computing

## Installation

Import the root project into IntelliJ. Current supported version is JDK 17.0.1 Corretto with Gradle 7.3. Expect
first-class support for the JVM backend, but other targets including JS may be used in the future. Imagine composing a
full quantum application within an Electron/JS/React app!
